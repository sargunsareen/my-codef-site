In 2018, I had the opportunity to go Interrailing with 3 other friends! What an experience! I learnt alot from it and Had an amazing time  went Interrailing in 2018 and learnt alot from it!

My top tips are:
1. Travel light- you will be carrying your backpack around a lot!
2. Book accommodation in advance.
1. Learn some basic words of the native language!
1. Budget carefully for food, accommodation, sight seeing etc. 
1. Check the currencies you will need and exchange beforehand.
1. Have a rough itinerary but donâ€™t be too rigid with it!
1. Take comfortable footwear- you are easily walking 30-40 thousand steps a day!
