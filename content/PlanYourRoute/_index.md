## Getting Started

Read up on places you are interested in visiting. Make a rough plan of what you want to get out of this experience.

Personally I travelled to Paris, Munich, Vienna, Salzburg, Budapest and Prague! For us, immersing into the culture of the destination was very important so sometimes we budgeted accordingly and were able to do everything we had set out to!
